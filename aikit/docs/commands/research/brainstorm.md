## Brainstorming Process

### 1. Problem Definition

Clarify the problem:
- What are we trying to solve?
- What are the constraints?
- What's the timeline?
- Who are the stakeholders?

### 2. Idea Generation

AIKit generates ideas by:
- **Quantity First**: Many ideas, then filter
- **Diverse Approaches**: Multiple angles
- **Feasible Solutions**: Can actually be implemented
- **Scalable Solutions**: Will work at scale

### 3. Evaluation

**Evaluate each idea:**
- Feasibility (can we do this?)
- Complexity (how hard?)
- Cost (time/money?)
- Impact (how much value?)
- Risk (what could go wrong?)

### 4. Categorization

Group ideas by:
- Quick wins (easy, high value)
- Strategic (complex, high value)
- Research items (need more info)
- Long-term (strategic, can wait)

### 5. Selection

Choose best options based on:
- Time constraints
- Resource availability
- Risk tolerance
- Value delivered

## Best Practices

### Effective Brainstorming

✅ **DO:**
- Start with quantity over quality
- Defer judgment during idea generation
- Consider all angles and perspectives
- Focus on solving the right problem
- Note constraints early

❌ **DON'T:**
- Critique ideas during generation
- Filter too aggressively
- Focus on practicality too early
- Ignore wild ideas completely
- Stop at first good idea

### After Brainstorming

✅ **DO:**
- Evaluate all ideas against criteria
- Prioritize by impact and effort
- Document evaluation criteria
- Select top 2-3 options for testing
- Save all ideas to memory

❌ **DON'T:**
- Select first idea without evaluation
- Forget non-selected ideas
- Implement without validation
- Skip documentation

### Idea Evaluation Criteria

**For each idea, consider:**
- **Impact**: How much value does this provide?
- **Effort**: How much work is required?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong?
- **Urgency**: Time-sensitive or can wait?
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be done first?
- **Alignment**: Does this fit our goals?
