# AIKit - What It Is & What It Does

## Overview

AIKit is an **Open-source AI coding agent toolkit** that extends OpenCode's capabilities with structured workflows, specialized agents, and integrated tools. It transforms OpenCode from a general-purpose coding assistant into a structured development environment with task tracking, quality enforcement, and cross-session continuity.

## Core Purpose

AIKit solves these problems in OpenCode:

1. **Lack of structured workflows** - OpenCode has agents but no enforced processes
2. **No task tracking** - Work happens without tracking what needs to be done
3. **No quality gates** - Code changes aren't automatically validated
4. **Lost context between sessions** - Previous work gets forgotten
5. **Inconsistent processes** - Different approaches for similar tasks
6. **No persistent memory** - Learnings aren't saved for future use

## What AIKit Provides

### 1. Skills System (42 Built-in Skills)

**What it does:** Enforces structured workflows for common development tasks.

**Built-in skills by category:**

- **Development:** test-driven-development, refactoring, error-handling, state-management
- **Testing:** unit-testing, integration-testing
- **Design:** api-design, component-design, database-design
- **UI/UX:** accessibility, frontend-aesthetics, performance-optimization
- **Debugging:** systematic-debugging
- **Review:** code-review, security-audit
- **Collaboration:** documentation, git-workflow, writing-plans
- **Meta:** using-superpowers, design-measurement
- **Figma:** analyze-figma, figma-to-code

**How it works in OpenCode:**
```
> use_skill("test-driven-development")
> Implement user authentication
# Agent now follows TDD workflow: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures consistent processes across tasks
- Prevents skipping important steps
- Embeds best practices into AI behavior
- Reduces AI hallucination by providing structured guidance

### 2. Specialized Agents (8 Agent Types)

**What it does:** Provides AI personas optimized for different types of work.

**Agent types:**

- **@planner** - Strategic planning and multi-agent coordination
- **@build** - Primary execution agent for implementing features
- **@rush** - Fast execution for quick fixes
- **@review** - Code review, security audits, debugging
- **@scout** - External research (docs, GitHub, frameworks)
- **@explore** - Fast codebase navigation and pattern search
- **@vision** - Multimodal analysis (mockups, PDFs, diagrams)
- **@one-shot** - End-to-end autonomous task execution

**How delegation works:**
```
> @planner Design authentication system
# @planner delegates to @scout to research patterns
# Then delegates to @build to implement
# Finally delegates to @review to verify
```

**Why this matters:**
- Right agent for the right task
- Automatic delegation when needed
- Specialized system prompts for each agent type
- Better quality through focused expertise

### 3. Slash Commands (42+ Commands)

- **Session Management** - Cross-session context transfer

**How plugins work:**
```typescript
// Hooks into events:
- session.idle - Session completed
- session.created - New session started
- session.error - Session error occurred
- tool.execute.before - Before tool execution
- tool.execute.after - After tool execution
- file.edited - File was edited
- message.updated - Message updated
```

**Why this matters:**

/finish
# Runs quality gates, completes bead
```

**Why this matters:**
- Tracks all work in one place
- Prevents lost tasks
- Enforces completion criteria
- Git-based tracking

### 7. Anti-Hallucination System (3 Layers)

**What it does:** Prevents AI from inventing APIs and losing track of requirements.

**Layer 1: Task Validation**
- Validates task exists before starting work
- Checks `.beads/` directory
- Requires "in-progress" status

**Layer 2: Spec Enforcement**
- Enforces code follows `spec.md` constraints
- Defines naming conventions
- Lists forbidden patterns
- Specifies required practices

**Layer 3: Review Gates**
- Documents changes in `review.md`
- Records what changed
- Records what was skipped
- Lists verification steps

**Quality Gates (hard requirements):**
1. `npm run typecheck` - No type errors
2. `npm run test` - All tests pass
3. `npm run lint` - No linting errors
4. `npm run build` - Build succeeds

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces AI errors
- Enforces project standards
- Prevents work on undefined tasks
- Ensures quality before completion

### 8. Persistent Memory System

**What it does:** Stores learnings, handoffs, and research for future sessions.

**Memory types:**

- **observations/** - Project patterns and learnings
- **handoffs/** - Session continuity bundles
- **research/** - Research findings
- **_templates/** - Memory templates

**How it works:**
```bash
# Save learning
> memory-update("observations/authentication-pattern", "Always use JWT with refresh tokens")

# Save research
> memory-update("research/figma-analysis", "# Design tokens...")

# Create handoff
/handoff
# Saves to memory/handoffs/[timestamp].md

# Resume later
/resume
# Loads latest handoff
```

**Why this matters:**
- Learnings persist across sessions
- Research findings are preserved
- Context transfer between sessions
- Collective intelligence over time

### 9. Session Management System
