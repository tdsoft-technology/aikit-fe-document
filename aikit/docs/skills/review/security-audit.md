# Security Audit Skill

Use this skill when auditing code for security vulnerabilities.

## Overview

Comprehensive security review focusing on common vulnerabilities and best practices.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Checking for security issues
- Auditing security
- Reviewing for vulnerabilities
- Conducting security review
- Performing security audit

## Workflow

### Step 1: Authentication & Authorization

Check:
- [ ] Strong password requirements
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] Proper logout functionality
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Token expiration
- [ ] Secure password storage (hashing)

**Red Flags:**
- Plain text passwords
- Weak password requirements
- No session timeout
- Missing authorization checks
- Tokens never expire

### Step 2: Input Validation

Check:
- [ ] All user input validated
- [ ] Server-side validation (not just client)
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Length limits
- [ ] Sanitization for XSS
- [ ] SQL injection prevention

**Common Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- NoSQL injection

### Step 3: Data Protection

Check:
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Secure headers (CSP, HSTS)
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Data at rest encrypted

**Security Headers:**
- Content-Security-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy

### Step 4: Dependency Security

Check:
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimal dependencies
- [ ] Regular security audits

**Tools:**
- `npm audit`
- Snyk
- Dependabot
- OWASP Dependency-Check

### Step 5: API Security

Check:
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Authentication required
- [ ] Proper error messages (no info leakage)
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Output encoding
- [ ] CORS properly configured

**API Best Practices:**
- Rate limiting
- Authentication tokens
- Generic error messages
- Input validation
- Output sanitization

### Step 6: Secrets Management

Check:
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Environment variables used
- [ ] Secrets rotated regularly
- [ ] Proper access controls
- [ ] No secrets in logs

**Red Flags:**
- API keys in code
- Passwords in config files
- Secrets in git history
- Secrets in logs
- Hardcoded credentials

### Step 7: Error Handling

Check:
- [ ] Generic error messages to users
- [ ] Detailed errors only in logs
- [ ] No stack traces to users
- [ ] Proper error logging
- [ ] No information leakage

## OWASP Top 10 (2021)

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable Components
7. Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

## Common Vulnerabilities

- SQL Injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Authentication bypass
- Insecure direct object references
- Security misconfiguration
- Sensitive data exposure
- Missing function level access control

## Verification

- [ ] Security audit tools run
- [ ] Dependencies checked
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation in place
- [ ] Authentication/authorization working
- [ ] Security headers configured
